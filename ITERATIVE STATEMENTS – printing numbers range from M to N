## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS – printing numbers range from M to N 

###  Aim
To Python Program to print numbers  range from M to N (including M and N values)

---

###  Algorithm

1. Prompt the user to enter the starting value M.  
2. Read the starting value and store it in a variable.  
3. Prompt the user to enter the ending value N.  
4. Read the ending value and store it in a variable.  
5. Use a loop to iterate from M to N, including both values.  
6. In each iteration of the loop, print the current number.  
7. Continue the loop until the number reaches N.
