### AIM  
To Write a python program to define a function that accepts 3 values and return its average  

---

### ALGORITHM

1. Define a function that takes three parameters.  
2. Inside the function, add the three values and divide the sum by 3 to calculate the average.  
3. Return the calculated average from the function.  
4. Prompt the user to enter the first number and store it.  
5. Prompt the user to enter the second number and store it.  
6. Prompt the user to enter the third number and store it.  
7. Call the function with the three input values as arguments.  
8. Store the returned average.  
9. Print the average value.
